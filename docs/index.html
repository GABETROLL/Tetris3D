                Tetris3D is a Python and Pygame script of Tetris, both in 2D and in 3D. 
                I first developed it as a personal project in 2022, with just the 2D mode,
                and I continued it as my final project for Holberton School, Puerto Rico.
                <br>
                <br>
                I really like Tetris. I have been playing it since 2018. I had first started playing Tetris in my then-phone,
                then I got into NES Tetris.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2022, I had made a small Tetris Pygame script as a personal project.
                This version of the game had pretty much every one of its rules exactly like
                the NES Tetris' rules were: the speed of the pieces falling, points, controls...,
                since it was what I was most familiar with, and since I really like that specific Tetris game.
                <br>
                <br>
                I was having trouble on what to do for my final project at Holberton, when I had my favorite game pop into my head: Tetris!
                <br>
                <br>
                I've always loved the idea of extending mathematical puzzles to have one more dimension than they already have,
                in the simplest way possible, so I decided to extend Tetris to 3 dimensions!
                <br>
                <br>
                And so I did. And the repository for that game IS the repository for this game.
            </p>
